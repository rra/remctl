/*
 * Replacement implementation of getnameinfo.
 *
 * This is an implementation of the getnameinfo function for systems that lack
 * it, so that code can use getnameinfo always.  It provides IPv4 support
 * only; for IPv6 support, a native getnameinfo implementation is required.
 *
 * This file should generally be included by way of portable/socket.h rather
 * than directly.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.
