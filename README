BLURB

  remctl is a client/server application that supports remote execution of
  specific commands, using Kerberos GSS-API for authentication.
  Authorization is controlled by a configuration file and ACL files and
  can be set separately for each command, unlike with rsh.  remctl is like
  a Kerberos-authenticated simple CGI server, or a combination of Kerberos
  ssh and sudo without most of the features and complexity of either.

DESCRIPTION

  remctl is a client/server application that supports remote execution of
  specific commands, using Kerberos GSS-API for authentication and
  confidentiality.  The commands a given user can execute are controlled
  by a configuration file and ACL files and can easily be tightly limited,
  unlike with rsh.  The mapping of command to backend program is done by
  the configuration file, which allows some additional flexibility
  compared to ssh command restrictions and works with Kerberos
  authentications rather than being limited to public key authentications.

  remctld is very similar to a CGI server that uses a different network
  protocol than HTTP, always does strong authentication before executing
  the desired command, and guarantees the data is encrypted on the
  network.  Alternately, you can think of it as a very simple combination
  of Kerberos ssh and sudo, without most of the features of both but with
  simpler authorization.

  There are a lot of different client/server systems that do something
  similar, including regular rsh, CGI, IBM's sysctl (not to be confused
  with the Linux kernel call and configuration file of the same name),
  CERN's arc, and more elaborate systems like MIT's Moira.  remctl has the
  advantage over many of these schemes of using GSS-API and being about as
  simple as it possibly can be while still being useful.  It doesn't
  require any particular programming language, builds self-contained
  binaries, and uses as minimal of a protocol as possible.

  Both C and Java clients and servers are provided, as well as Perl, PHP,
  and Python bindings for the C client library.  For more information
  about the Java client, see java/README.  For more information about the
  PHP bindings, see php/README.  For more information about the Python
  bindings, see python/README.

  Also included in the remctl package is an alternate way of running the
  remctl server: remctl-shell.  This program is designed to be run as
  either a shell or a forced command under ssh, using ssh for
  authentication and communicating the authentication information to
  remctl-shell via either environment variables or command-line arguments
  via the forced command configuration.  This version of the server uses
  simple ssh clients, rather than using the remctl client program or
  libraries.

  remctl was originally written by Anton Ushakov as a replacement for
  IBM's sysctl, a client/server application with Kerberos v4
  authentication that allowed the client to run Tcl code on the server,
  protected by ACLs.  At Stanford, we used sysctl extensively, but mostly
  only to run external programs, so remctl was developed as a Kerberos v5
  equivalent that did only the portions we needed.

  Complete protocol documentation is available in docs/protocol.html.
  Also present, as docs/design.html, is the original design document (now
  somewhat out of date).

REQUIREMENTS

  The remctld server and the standard client are written in C and require
  a C compiler and GSS-API libraries to build.  Both will build against
  either MIT Kerberos or Heimdal of any reasonable vintage.  remctl will
  also build against the Kerberos GSS-API implementation shipped with AIX
  5.2 (and possibly later versions) and the Solaris 10 generic GSS-API
  library (and possibly later versions).  The remctl_set_ccache
  implementation is improved by building with Kerberos libraries and a
  GSS-API library that supports gss_krb5_import_cred.

  The remctld server requires libevent 1.4.x or later.  It's only been
  tested with libevent 1.4.13-stable and later, but should work with 1.4.4
  or later.  It is now only tested with libevent 2.x, so moving to a later
  version of libevent if possible is recommended.

  The remctl server will support regex ACLs if the system supports the
  POSIX regex API.  The remctl server also optionally supports PCRE
  regular expressions in ACLs.  To include that support, the PCRE library
  is required.

  To build the remctl client for Windows, the Microsoft Windows SDK for
  Windows Vista and the MIT Kerberos for Windows SDK are required, along
  with a Microsoft Windows build environment (probably Visual Studio).
  remctl has only been tested with the 3.2.1 MIT Kerberos for Windows SDK.
  To run the resulting binary, MIT Kerberos for Windows must be installed
  and configured.  The client was tested on Windows XP and Vista and
  should work on Windows 2000 and up; however, the primary maintainer does
  not use or test Windows, so it's always possible Windows support has
  broken.  The server is not supported on Windows.

  To build the Perl bindings for the C client library, you will need Perl
  5.8 or later.

  To build the PHP bindings for the C client library, you will need PHP
  5.x or later and phpize, plus any other programs that phpize requires.
  PHP 5.x support has only been tested on 5.2 and 5.3, and PHP support is
  now only tested on PHP 7.x and later.

  To build the Python bindings for the C client library, you will need
  Python 2.3 or later (primarily tested with Python 2.7).  Python 3 is not
  (yet) supported.

  To build the Ruby bindings for the C client library, you will need Ruby
  1.8 or later (primarily tested with 2.5 and later).

  None of the language bindings have been tested on Windows.

  A Java client and Java server are available in the java subdirectory,
  but they are not integrated into the normal build or built by default.
  There is a basic Makefile in that directory that may require some
  tweaking.  It currently requires the Sun Java JDK (1.4.2, 5, or 6) or
  OpenJDK 6 or later.  A considerably better Java client implementation is
  available on the java branch in the Git repository but has not yet been
  merged.

  To bootstrap from a Git checkout, or if you change the Automake files
  and need to regenerate Makefile.in, you will need Automake 1.11 or
  later.  For bootstrap or if you change configure.ac or any of the m4
  files it includes and need to regenerate configure or config.h.in, you
  will need Autoconf 2.64 or later.  Perl is also required to generate
  manual pages from a fresh Git checkout.  You will also need pkg-config
  installed to regenerate configure and xml2rfc to build the formatted
  protocol documentation.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  You can build and install remctl with the standard commands:

      ./configure
      make
      make install

  If you are building from a Git clone, first run ./bootstrap in the
  source directory to generate the build files.  make install will
  probably have to be done as root.  Building outside of the source
  directory is also supported, if you wish, by creating an empty directory
  and then running configure with the correct relative path.

  Solaris users should look at examples/remctld.xml, an SMF manifest for
  running the remctld daemon.

  To also build the Perl bindings for the libremctl client library, pass
  the --enable-perl option to configure.  The Perl module build is handled
  by the normal Perl extension build system, and therefore will be built
  with compiler flags defined by your Perl installation and installed into
  your local Perl module directory regardless of the --prefix argument to
  configure.  To change this, you will need to run perl Makefile.PL in the
  perl subdirectory of the build tree with appropriate options and rebuild
  the module after running make and before running make install.

  To also build the remctl PECL extension for PHP, pass the --enable-php
  option to configure.  The PHP PECL module build is handled by the normal
  PHP extension build system and therefore will be installed into your
  local PHP module directory.  The configure script will look for phpize
  on your PATH by default; if it's in some other directory, set the PHPIZE
  environment variable to the full path or set it on the configure command
  line.  The configure script for the PECL extension will be run during
  the build instead of during configure.  This is unfortunately apparently
  unavoidable given how the PECL build system works.

  To also build the Python bindings for the libremctl client library, pass
  the --enable-python option to configure.  The Python module build is
  handled by the normal Python extension build system, and therefore will
  be installed into your local Python module directory regardless of the
  --prefix argument to configure.  To change this, you will need to run
  python setup.py install by hand in the python directory with whatever
  options you want to use.

  To also build the Ruby bindings for the libremctl client library, pass
  the --enable-ruby option to configure.  The Ruby module build is handled
  by the normal Ruby module build system, and therefore will be installed
  into your local Ruby module directory regardless of the --prefix
  argument to configure.  To change this, override the sitedir variable on
  the make install command line, as in:

      make install sitedir=/opt/ruby

  The remctl build system also supports a few other environment variables
  that can be set to control aspects of the Perl, Python, and Ruby binding
  build systems.  These are primarily only of use when packaging the
  software.  For more information, a list of the variables, and their
  effects, see the comment at the start of Makefile.am.

  The Java client and server aren't integrated with the regular build
  system.  For information on building and installing them, see
  java/README.

  remctl will use pkg-config if it's available to find the build flags for
  libevent.  You can control which pkg-config binary and paths are used
  with the normal pkg-config environment variables of PKG_CONFIG,
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR, and you can override the
  pkg-config results with LIBEVENT_CFLAGS and LIBEVENT_LIBS.  Alternately,
  you can bypass pkg-config by passing one or more of --with-libevent,
  --with-libevent-include, and --with-libevent-lib to indicate the install
  prefix, include directory, or library directory.

  remctl will automatically build with PCRE support if pcre-config or the
  PCRE library are found.  You can pass --with-pcre to configure to
  specify the root directory where PCRE is installed, or set the include
  and library directories separately with --with-pcre-include and
  --with-pcre-lib.  You can also set PCRE_CONFIG to point to a different
  pcre-config script, or do similar things as with PATH_KRB5_CONFIG
  described below.

  remctl will automatically build with GPUT support if the GPUT header and
  library are found.  You can pass --with-gput to configure to specify the
  root directory where GPUT is installed, or set the include and library
  directories separately with --with-gput-include and --with-gput-lib.

  Normally, configure will use krb5-config to determine the flags to use
  to compile with your Kerberos libraries.  To specify a particular
  krb5-config script to use, either set the PATH_KRB5_CONFIG environment
  variable or pass it to configure like:

      ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config

  If krb5-config isn't found, configure will look for the standard
  Kerberos libraries in locations already searched by your compiler.  If
  the the krb5-config script first in your path is not the one
  corresponding to the Kerberos libraries you want to use, or if your
  Kerberos libraries and includes aren't in a location searched by default
  by your compiler, you need to specify a different Kerberos installation
  root via --with-krb5=PATH.  For example:

      ./configure --with-krb5=/usr/pubsw

  You can also individually set the paths to the include directory and the
  library directory with --with-krb5-include and --with-krb5-lib.  You may
  need to do this if Autoconf can't figure out whether to use lib, lib32,
  or lib64 on your platform.

  To not use krb5-config and force library probing even if there is a
  krb5-config script on your path, set PATH_KRB5_CONFIG to a nonexistent
  path:

      ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent

  krb5-config is not used and library probing is always done if either
  --with-krb5-include or --with-krb5-lib are given.

  GSS-API libraries are found the same way: with krb5-config by default if
  it is found, and a --with-gssapi=PATH flag to specify the installation
  root.  PATH_KRB5_CONFIG is similarly used to find krb5-config for the
  GSS-API libraries, and --with-gssapi-include and --with-gssapi-lib can
  be used to specify the exact paths, overriding any krb5-config results.

  Pass --enable-silent-rules to configure for a quieter build (similar to
  the Linux kernel).  Use make warnings instead of make to build with full
  GCC compiler warnings (requires a relatively current version of GCC).

  You can pass the --enable-reduced-depends flag to configure to try to
  minimize the shared library dependencies encoded in the binaries.  This
  omits from the link line all the libraries included solely because other
  libraries depend on them and instead links the programs only against
  libraries whose APIs are called directly.  This will only work with
  shared libraries and will only work on platforms where shared libraries
  properly encode their own dependencies (this includes most modern
  platforms such as all Linux).  It is intended primarily for building
  packages for Linux distributions to avoid encoding unnecessary shared
  library dependencies that make shared library migrations more difficult.
  If none of the above made any sense to you, don't bother with this flag.

TESTING

  remctl comes with a comprehensive test suite, but it requires some
  configuration in order to test anything other than low-level utility
  functions.  For the full test suite, you will need to have a keytab that
  can authenticate to a running KDC.  Using a test KDC environment, if you
  have one, is recommended.

  Follow the instructions in tests/config/README to configure the test
  suite.

  Now, you can run the test suite with:

      make check

  If a test fails, you can run a single test with verbose output via:

      tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>

  Do this instead of running the test program directly since it will
  ensure that necessary environment variables are set up.

  On particularly slow or loaded systems, you may see intermittant
  failures from the server/streaming test because it's timing-sensitive.

  The test suite will also need to be able to bind to 127.0.0.1 on port
  11119 and 14373 to run test network server programs.

  To test anonymous authentication, the KDC configured in the test suite
  needs to support service tickets for the anonymous identity (not a
  standard configuration).  This test will be skipped if the KDC does not
  support this.

  To test user handling in remctld, you will need the fakeroot command
  (available in the fakeroot package in Debian and Ubuntu).  This test
  will be skipped if fakeroot isn't available.

  The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite for
  the main package and the Perl bindings if installed:

  * Test::MinimumVersion
  * Test::Perl::Critic
  * Test::Pod
  * Test::Spelling
  * Test::Strict
  * Test::Synopsis

  All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
  are not available.

  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.

BUILDING ON WINDOWS

  (These instructions are not tested by the author and are now dated.
  Updated instructions via a pull request, issue, or email are very
  welcome.)

  First, install the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Vista if you have
  not already.  This is a free download from Microsoft for users of
  "Genuine Microsoft Windows."  The vcvars32.bat environment provided by
  Visual Studio may work as an alternative, but has not been tested.

  Next, install the MIT Kerberos for Windows SDK [1].  remctl has been
  tested with version 3.2.1 but should hopefully work with later versions.

  Then, follow these steps:

  1. Run the InitEnv.cmd script included with the Windows SDK with
     parameters "/xp /release".

  2. Run the configure.bat script, giving it as an argument the location
     of the Kerberos for Windows SDK.  For example, if you installed the KfW
     SDK in "c:\KfW SDK", you should run:

         configure "c:\KfW SDK"

  3. Run nmake to start compiling.  You can ignore the warnings.

  If all goes well, you will have remctl.exe and remctl.dll.  The latter
  is a shared library used by the client program.  It exports the same
  interface as the UNIX libremctl library.
