=head1 NAME

remctl_close - Close a remctl connection and free the client object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

void B<remctl_close>(struct remctl *I<r>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_close() cleanly closes any connection to a remote server created
via remctl_open() for the given client object and then frees the object
created by remctl_new().  It should be called when the caller is finished
with a remctl client object to avoid resource leaks.  Following the call
to remctl_close(), the I<r> pointer to the remctl client object is no
longer valid.

remctl_close() is always successful, even if it is unable to send a clean
protocol quit command to the remote server.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This interface has been provided by the remctl client library since its
initial release in version 2.0.
