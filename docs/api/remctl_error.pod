=head1 NAME

remctl_error - Retrieve the error from a failed remctl operation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

const char *B<remctl_error>(struct remctl *I<r>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_error() returns the error from a previously failed remctl
operation.  Its only argument is a remctl struct as returned by
remctl_new().  If the previous remctl operation was successful, returns
the constant string "No error".

The caller may not modify the returned string.  The string may even be
stored in read-only memory and attempting to modify it may cause a memory
fault.  The returned pointer will be invalidated by the next call to any
remctl API function with the same client object, other than
remctl_error().

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_error() returns either the previous error or the constant string
"No error".  It will never return NULL.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This interface has been provided by the remctl client library since its
initial release in version 2.0.
