=head1 NAME

remctl_set_source_ip - Set source IP for remctl client connections

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

int B<remctl_set_source_ip>(struct remctl *I<r>, const char *I<source>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_set_source_ip() sets the source IP address for subsequent calls to
remctl_open() on the same struct remctl object.  Call this function before
remctl_open() if remctl client connections need to come from a specific
source IP.

The I<source> parameter may be an IPv4 or IPv6 address (assuming the host
supports IPv6).

Be aware that if you set an IPv4 source address and then attempt to
connect to an IPv6 address or IPv6-only host, or if you set an IPv6
address and then attempt to connect to an IPv4 address or IPv4-only host,
you will get a connection failure error from remctl_open().

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_set_source_ip() returns true on success and false on failure.  On
failure, the caller should call remctl_error() to retrieve the error
message.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This interface was added in version 3.0.
