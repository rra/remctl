=head1 NAME

remctl_set_ccache - Set credential cache for remctl client connections

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

int B<remctl_set_ccache>(struct remctl *I<r>, const char *I<ccache>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_set_ccache() tells the the remctl client library to use I<ccache>
as the credential cache for authentication to a remctl server.  It will
affect any subsequent remctl_open() calls on the same struct remctl object
(and may have broader effects; see L<WARNINGS> below).  I<ccache> is
normally a path to a file in the file system that holds Kerberos
credentials, but may take other values depending on the underlying
Kerberos implementation used by GSS-API.

Calling this function will normally override any KRB5CCNAME environment
setting.  If the caller wishes to honor that setting, it should either not
call this function or check whether that environment variable is set
first.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_set_ccache() returns true on success and false on failure.  On
failure, the caller should call remctl_error() to retrieve the error
message.

This function will always return failure if the underlying GSS-API
implementation against which the remctl client library was compiled does
not support setting the Kerberos credential cache.  The caller should be
prepared for that.  Falling back on setting the KRB5CCNAME environment
variable is often a reasonable choice.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Here's an example of attempting to use this function to set a ticket cache
location and falling back on setting KRB5CCNAME in the environment if this
function is not supported.

    struct remctl r;

    r = remctl_new();
    if (r != NULL)
        if (!remctl_set_ccache(r, "/tmp/krb5cc_example"))
            putenv("KRB5CCNAME=/tmp/krb5cc_example");

This assumes that any failure is due to lack of support from the
underlying library rather than some other cause.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This interface was added in version 3.0, but that version would always
change the ticket cache used by all GSS-API calls in the same process.
Support for the gss_krb5_import_cred() method of isolating the changed
ticket cache to only this remctl client object was added in version 3.5.

=head1 WARNINGS

The effect of this function is only localized to this specific remctl
client context if the remctl client library was built against a Kerberos
as well as GSS-API library and the GSS-API library supported
gss_krb5_import_cred().  Otherwise, it falls back to calling
gss_krb5_ccache_name(), which sets the credential cache used by the
underlying GSS-API library for every GSS-API operation in the current
execution context (process or thread), not just for this remctl object or
even just for remctl operations.  This function may therefore change
global execution state and may affect other GSS-API operations done
elsewhere in the same process.
