=head1 NAME

remctl_noop - Send a NOOP message to a remctl server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

int B<remctl_noop>(struct remctl *I<r>);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_noop() sends a NOOP message to a remctl server and reads the
expected NOOP response.  This is primarily used to keep a connection to a
remctl server alive, such as through a firewall with a session timeout,
while waiting to issue further commands.

The NOOP message requires protocol version 3 support in the server, so the
caller should be prepared for this function to fail, indicating that the
connection could not be kept alive and possibly that it was closed by the
server.  In this case, the client will need to explicitly reopen the
connection with remctl_open().

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_noop() returns true on success and false on failure.  On failure,
the caller should call remctl_error() to retrieve the error message.  In
addition to network errors, this function may fail if the server doesn't
support protocol version 3.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This interface was added in version 3.0.
