=head1 NAME

remctl_new - Create a new remctl client

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <remctl.h>

struct remctl *B<remctl_new>(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

remctl_new() creates a new remctl client.  The resulting remctl struct is
opaque from the perspective of the caller, but should be the first
argument to all subsequent calls into the remctl API.  Normally, the next
call after remctl_new() would be remctl_open() to connect to a remote
server.

The resulting struct should be freed by calling remctl_close().

=head1 RETURN VALUE

remctl_new() returns a pointer to an opaque remctl struct on success and
NULL on failure.  If it returns NULL, errno will be set to an appropriate
error code (normally ENOMEM).

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This interface has been provided by the remctl client library since its
initial release in version 2.0.
