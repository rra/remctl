# I prefer this policy (a lot, actually), but other people in my group at
# Stanford really didn't like it, so this is my compromise to agree with a
# group coding style.
[-CodeLayout::ProhibitParensWithBuiltins]

# Stanford's coding style allows postfix unless for flow control.  There
# doesn't appear to be any way to allow it only for flow control (the logic
# for "if" and "when" appears to be special-cased), so we have to allow unless
# globally.
[ControlStructures::ProhibitPostfixControls]
allow = unless

# This is handled with a separate test case that uses Test::Spelling.
[-Documentation::PodSpelling]

# Pod::Man and Pod::Text fixed this bug years ago.  I know, I maintain them.
[-Documentation::RequirePodLinksIncludeText]

# The POD sections Perl::Critic wants are incompatible with the POD template
# from perlpodstyle, which is what I use for my POD documentation.
[-Documentation::RequirePodSections]

# This problem was fixed in Perl 5.14, which now properly preserves the value
# of $@ even if destructors run at exit from the eval block.

# This is correct 80% of the time, but it isn't correct for a lot of scripts
# inside packages, where maintaining $VERSION isn't worth the effort.
# Unfortunately, there's no way to override it, so it gets turned off
# globally.
[-Modules::RequireVersionVar]

# This sounds interesting but is actually useless.  Any large blocks of
# literal text, which does not add to the complexity of the regex, will set it
# off.
[-RegularExpressions::ProhibitComplexRegexes]

# Produces false positives currently with postfix dereferencing (introduced in

# I generally don't want to require Readonly as a prerequisite for all my Perl
# modules.
[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitConstantPragma]

# A good idea, but there are too many places where this would be more
# confusing than helpful.  Pull out numbers if one might change them
# independent of the algorithm, but don't do so for mathematical formulae.

# Increase this to six digits so that I'm not told to add underscores to

# use English was one of the worst ideas in the history of Perl.  It makes the
# code slightly more readable for amateurs at the cost of confusing
# experienced Perl programmers and sending people in futile quests for where
# these magical global variables are defined.
