=head1 NAME

Net::Remctl::Backend - Helper infrastructure for remctl backend programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Remctl::Backend;

    my %commands = (
        cmd1 => { code => \&run_cmd1 },
        cmd2 => { code => \&run_cmd2 },
    );
    my $backend = Net::Remctl::Backend->new({
        commands => \%commands,
    });
    exit $backend->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Remctl::Backend provides a framework for remctl backend commands
(commands run by B<remctld>).  It can be configured with a list of
supported subcommands and handles all the command-line parsing and syntax
checking, dispatching the command to the appropriate sub if it is valid.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(CONFIG)

Create a new backend object with the given configuration.  CONFIG should
be an anonymous hash with one or more of the following keys:

=over 4

=item command

If set, defines the base remctl command implemented by this backend.  The
primary use of this string is in usage and help output.  If set, it will
be added to the beginning of each command syntax description so that the
help output will match the remctl command that the user actually runs.

=item commands

The value of this key should be an anonymous hash describing all of the
commands that are supported.  See below for the supported keys in the
command configuration.

=item help_banner

If set, the value will be displayed as the first line of help output.
Recommended best practice is to use a string of the form:

    <service> remctl help:

where <service> is something like C<Event handling> or C<User database> or
whatever this set of commands generally does or manipulates.

=back

The commands key, described above, takes a hash of properties for each
subcommand supported by this backend.  The possible keys in that hash are:

=over 4

=item args_match

A reference to an array of regexes that must match the arguments to this
function.  Each element of the array is matched against the corresponding
element in the array of arguments, and if the corresponding regular
expression does not match, the command will be rejected with an error
about an invalid argument.  Set the regular expression to undef to not
check the corresponding argument.

There is currently no way to check all arguments in commands that take any
number of arguments.

=item args_max

The maximum number of arguments.  If there are more than this number of
arguments, run() will die with an error message without running the
command.

=item args_min

The minimum number of arguments.  If there are fewer than this number of
arguments, run() will die with an error message without running the
command.

=item code

A reference to the sub that implements this command.  This sub will be
called with the arguments passed on the command line as its arguments
(possibly preceded by the options hash if the C<options> parameter is set
as described below).  It should return the exit status that should be used
by the backend as a whole: 0 for success and some non-zero value for an
error condition.  This sub should print to STDOUT and STDERR to
communicate back to the remctl client.

=item nested

If set, indicates that this is a nested command.  The value should be a
nested hash of command definitions, the same as the parameter to the
C<commands> argument to new().  When this is set, the first argument to
this command is taken to be a subcommand name, which is looked up in the
hash.  All of the hash parameters are interpreted the same as if it were a
top-level command.

If this command is called without any arguments, behavior varies based on
whether the C<code> parameter is also set alongside the C<nested>
parameter.  If C<code> is set, the command is called normally, with no
arguments.  If C<code> is not set, calling this command without a
subcommand is treated as an unknown command.

=item options

A reference to an array of Getopt::Long option specifications.  If this
setting is present, the arguments passed to run() will be parsed by
Getopt::Long using this option specification first, before any other
option processing (including checking for minimum and maximum numbers of
arguments, checking the validity of arguments, or replacing arguments with
data from standard input).  The result of parsing options will be passed,
as a reference to a hash, as the first argument to the code that
implements this command, with all remaining arguments passed as the
subsequent arguments.

For example, if this is set to C<['help|h', 'version|v']> and the arguments
passed to run() are:

    command -hv foo bar

then the code implementing C<command> will be called with the following
arguments:

    { help => 1, version => 1 }, 'foo', 'bar'

Getopt::Long will always be configured with the options C<bundling>,
C<no_ignore_case>, and C<require_order>.  This means, among other things,
that the first non-option argument will stop option parsing and all
remaining arguments will be passed through verbatim.

If Getopt::Long rejects the options (due to an unknown option or an
invalid argument to an option, for example), run() will die with the error
message from Getopt::Long without running the command.

=item stdin

Specifies that one argument to this function should be read from standard
input.  All of the data on standard input until end of file will be read
into memory, and that data will become the argument number given by the
value of this key is the argument (based at 1).  So if this property is
set to 1, the first argument will be the data from standard input, and any
other arguments will be shifted down accordingly.  The value may be -1, in
which case the data from standard input will become the last argument, no
matter how many arguments there currently are.

Checks for the number of arguments and for the validity of arguments with
regular expression verification are done after reading the data from
standard input and transforming the argument list accordingly.

=item summary

The summary of what this subcommand does, as text.  Ideally, this should
fit on the same line with the syntax after the help output has been laid
out in columns.  If it is too long to fit, it will be wrapped, with each
subsequent line indented to the column where the summaries start.

If this key is omitted, the subcommand will still be shown in help
output, provided that it has a syntax key, but without any trailing
summary.

=item syntax

The syntax of this subcommand.  This should be short, since it needs to
fit on the same line as the summary of what this subcommand does.  Both
the command and subcommand should be omitted; the former will be set by
the I<command> parameter to the new() constructor for
Net::Remctl::Backend, and the latter will come from the command itself.  A
typical example will look like:

    syntax => '<object>'

which will result in help output (assuming I<command> is set to C<object>
and this parameter is set on the C<delete> command) that looks like:

    object delete <object>

Use abbreviations heavily to keep this string short so that the help
output will remain readable.

Set this key to the empty string to indicate that this subcommand takes
no arguments or flags.

If this key is omitted, the subcommand will be omitted from help output.

=back

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item help()

Returns the formatted help summary for the commands supported by this
backend.  This is the same as would be printed to standard output in
response to the command C<help> with no arguments.  The output will
consist of the syntax and summary attributes for each command that has a
syntax attribute defined, as described above under the command
specification.  It will be wrapped to 80 columns.

=item run([COMMAND[, ARG ...]])

Parse the command line and perform the appropriate action.  The return
value will be the return value of the command run (if any), which should
be the exit status that the backend script should use.

The command (which is the remctl subcommand) and arguments can be passed
directly to run() as parameters.  If no arguments are passed, run()
expects @ARGV to contain the parameters passed to the backend script.
Either way the first argument will be the subcommand, used to find the
appropriate command to run, and any remaining arguments will be arguments
to that command.  (Note that if the C<options> parameter is set, the first
argument passed to the underlying command will be the options hash.)

If there are errors in the parameters to the command, run() will die with
an appropriate error message.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Since Net::Remctl::Backend is designed to handle command line parsing for
a script and report appropriate errors if there are problems with the
argument, its run() method may die with various errors.  The possible
errors are listed below.  All will be terminated with a newline so the
Perl context information won't be appended.

=over 4

=item %s: insufficient arguments

The given command was configured with a C<args_min> parameter, and the
user passed in fewer arguments than that.

=item %s: invalid argument: %s

The given argument to the given command failed to match a regular
expression that was set with an C<args_match> parameter.

=item %s: too many arguments

The given command was configured with a C<args_max> parameter, and the
user passed in more arguments than that.

=back

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

This module was added in the 3.4 release of remctl.  Since 3.5, the module
version matches the remctl version but with a leading zero added so that
the minor version always has two numbers (so Net::Remctl::Backend 3.05 was
included in remctl 3.5).

All currently-supported methods and options have been supported since the
original release of the module.

=head1 BUGS

There is no way to check all arguments with a regex when the command
supports any number of arguments.
