# /etc/xinetd.d/remctl -- xinetd configuration for remctl.
#
# By default, remctl runs as root and the programs it runs are responsible
# for dropping privileges where appropriate.  If all of the programs you
# run are run by the same user, you may wish to start remctld as a user
# other than root.  If you do, it will still need to be able to read the
# host keytab (or some other keytab, if you specify a different principal
# in the client).
