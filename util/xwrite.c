/*
 * write and writev replacements to handle partial writes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     ssize_t xwrite(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte);
 *     ssize_t xpwrite(int fildes, const void *buf, size_t nbyte,
 *                     off_t offset);
 *     ssize_t xwritev(int fildes, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);
 *
 * xwrite, xpwrite, and xwritev behave exactly like their C library
 * counterparts except that, if write or writev succeeds but returns a number
 * of bytes written less than the total bytes, the write is repeated picking
 * up where it left off until the full amount of the data is written.  The
 * write is also repeated if it failed with EINTR.  The write will be aborted
 * after 10 successive writes with no forward progress.
 *
 * Both functions return the number of bytes written on success or -1 on an
 * error, and will leave errno set to whatever the underlying system call set
 * it to.  Note that it is possible for a write to fail after some data was
 * written, on the subsequent additional write; in that case, these functions
 * will return -1 and the number of bytes actually written will be lost.
 *
 * The canonical version of this file is maintained in the rra-c-util package,
 * which can be found at <https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/rra-c-util/>.
