/*
 * Vector handling (counted lists of char *'s).
 *
 * A vector is a table for handling a list of strings with less overhead than
 * linked list.  The intention is for vectors, once allocated, to be reused;
 * this saves on memory allocations once the array of char *'s reaches a
 * stable size.
 *
 * There are two types of vectors.  Standard vectors copy strings when they're
 * inserted into the vector, whereas cvectors just accept pointers to external
 * strings to store.  There are therefore two entry points for every vector
 * function, one for vectors and one for cvectors.
 *
 * Vectors require list of strings, not arbitrary binary data, and cannot
 * handle data elements containing nul characters.
 *
 * There's a whole bunch of code duplication here.  This would be a lot
 * cleaner with C++ features (either inheritance or templates would probably
 * help).  One could probably in some places just cast a cvector to a vector
 * and perform the same operations, but I'm leery of doing that as I'm not
 * sure if it's a violation of the C type aliasing rules.
