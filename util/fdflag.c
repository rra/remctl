/*
 * Set a file descriptor to nonblocking (or clear the nonblocking flag if flag
 * is false), returning true on success and false on failure.
 *
 * For Windows, be aware that this will only work for sockets.  For UNIX, you
 * can pass a non-socket in and it will do the right thing, since UNIX doesn't
 * distinguish, but Windows will not allow that.  Thankfully, there's rarely
 * any need to set non-sockets non-blocking.
 *
 * For UNIX, always use O_NONBLOCK; O_NDELAY is not the same thing
 * historically.  The semantics of O_NDELAY are that if the read would block,
 * it returns 0 instead.  This is indistinguishable from an end of file
 * condition.  POSIX added O_NONBLOCK, which requires read to return -1 and
 * set errno to EAGAIN, which is what we want.
 *
 * FNDELAY (4.3BSD) originally did the correct thing, although it has a
 * different incompatibility (affecting all users of a socket rather than just
 * a file descriptor and returning EWOULDBLOCK instead of EAGAIN) that we
 * probably don't care about.  Using it is probably safe, but BSD should also
 * have the ioctl, and at least on Solaris FNDELAY does the same thing as
 * O_NDELAY, not O_NONBLOCK.  So if we don't have O_NONBLOCK, fall back to the
 * ioctl instead.
 *
 * Reference:  Stevens, Advanced Unix Programming, pg. 364.
 *
 * Note that O_NONBLOCK is known not to work on earlier versions of ULTRIX,
 * SunOS, and AIX, possibly not setting the socket nonblocking at all, despite
 * the fact that they do define it.  It works in later SunOS and, current AIX,
 * however, and a 1999-10-25 survey of current operating systems failed to
 * turn up any that didn't handle it correctly (as required by POSIX), while
 * HP-UX 11.00 did use the broken return-zero semantics of O_NDELAY (most
 * other operating systems surveyed treated O_NDELAY as synonymous with
 * O_NONBLOCK).  Accordingly, we currently unconditionally use O_NONBLOCK.  If
 * this causes too many problems, an autoconf test may be required.
