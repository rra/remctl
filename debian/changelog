remctl (3.13-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - remctl-shell now supports being run as a forced command.
    - The summary configuration option is now allowed for commands with
      subcommands other than ALL, passing in two arguments to the summary
      command.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Oct 2016 19:23:31 -0700

remctl (3.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - New server implementation, remctl-shell, included in the
      remctl-server package, which is meant to be run as the shell of a
      dedicated user via ssh and supports the same configuration as
      remctld.  (This may eventually move into a separate package; if you
      would like to see that, file a bug.)
    - New server configuration option, sudo, which says to change users
      with sudo when running the command.
  * Hard-code the path to sudo in the build so that the sudo package
    doesn't have to be installed when building the package.
  * Switch to the new comment character for php-remctl.ini.
  * Switch to https for all package metadata URLs.
  * Remove now-unneeded source Lintian override.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.8 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 29 Jul 2016 13:23:57 -0700

remctl (3.11-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Port to PHP 7.  (Closes: #821713)
  * Convert packaging to use dh_php and build php-remctl instead of
    php5-remctl (and provide php7.0-remctl).  There is no upgrade path
    defined from php5-remctl, since that seems to be the way other PHP
    packages are being handled during the upgrade.
  * Switch to the DEP-14 branch layout and update debian/gbp.conf and
    Vcs-Git accordingly.
  * Belatedly bump shlibs for interfaces added in remctl 3.3.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 07 May 2016 15:15:46 -0700

remctl (3.10-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - New server ACLs anyuser:auth and anyuser:anonymous.  The latter
      allows access by anonymous clients if the KDC supports anonymous
      service tickets.
    - Server now sets the REMOTE_EXPIRES environment variable to the time
      when the client credentials would expire.
    - Anonymous users no longer satisfy ANYUSER (anyuser:auth).
    - Simplify the Python RemctlError class (with some backward
      incompatibilities).
    - Dynamically resize the buffer used for the localgroup ACL scheme,
      allowing support of users in large numbers of local groups.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 27 Nov 2015 15:24:56 -0800

remctl (3.9-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build against libsystemd instead of libsystemd-daemon.  Thanks,
    Michael Biebl.  (Closes: #779764)
  * Add explicit build dependency on libmodule-build-perl, since it will
    soon no longer be provided by the perl package.  (Closes: #791666)
  * Add debian/gbp.conf reflecting the branch layout of the default
    packaging repository.
  * Refresh upstream signing key.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.6 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 08 Aug 2015 11:16:49 -0700

remctl (3.9-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - New server ACL type, localgroup, which converts the principal to a
      local username and then checks for membership in a local group.
    - Fix incorrect handling of interruptions of network writes by signals
      in the server.
    - Prefer calloc and reallocarray when allocating memory with
      multiplication.
    - Restore the SIGPIPE handler before running a command.
    - Add version and compatibility information to all manual pages.
  * Use an executable debian/libnet-remctl-perl.install file to pull the
    correct Perl arch-specific vendor module path from Perl during the
    build.  Should fix builds with Perl 5.20.  Thanks, Niko Tyni and
    gregor herrmann.  (Closes: #752902)
  * Build-Depend on krb5-config to get enough of a Kerberos configuration
    for some test cases that are KDC-independent to run.
  * Fix Upstream-Contact email address in debian/copyright.
  * Remove most debian/tmp prefixes from debhelper *.install files.  These
    have not been needed since compat level 7.  Retain them only for the
    remctl-server.install file, which pulls files from both the source
    tree and the installed binary tree and benefits from the
    disambiguation.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Jul 2014 20:57:10 -0700

remctl (3.8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build-Depend on the version of gem2deb with working multi-binary
    package support for native extensions.
  * Fix the exclusion rule for dh_install --fail-missing to ignore the
    Ruby module under both the 2.0 and 1.9.1 paths.  (dh_ruby --install
    will go back and install the module in the correct locations.)  Should
    fix FTBFS in Ubuntu, which still has Ruby 1.9.1.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2014 13:27:58 -0700

remctl (3.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add upstream patch to increase the buffer size on timeout tests.
    Linux has apparently increased the size of network writes it is
    willing to buffer internally, so we now have to write more data to
    force a timeout.  (Closes: #743991)
  * Use gem2deb to build and install the Ruby module.  This will
    automatically use the current supported Ruby versions, avoiding the
    need for sourceful uploads for new Ruby releases.  Thanks to Christian
    Hofstaedtler for the patch.
  * Remove now-unneeded Lintian override for the upstream signing key.
  * Add a Lintian override for the dual-licensed protocol specification.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Apr 2014 19:34:24 -0700

remctl (3.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - remctld now uses libevent for the process event loop, which removes
      the need to poll for child exit and will make the server faster and
      more responsive.
    - Fill each MESSAGE_OUTPUT message from the server with the maximum
      allowed data per the protocol, rather than capping it artificially
      at 65000 octets.
    - Fix a minor server memory leak when processing help commands.
    - Fix a minor client memory leak on errors with protocol one commands.
    - Write out the server PID file atomically.
  * Start building the Ruby extension for Ruby 2.0 and stop building it
    for Ruby 1.8, which is being removed.  (Closes: #735659)
  * Add Depends on ruby | ruby-interpreter to ruby-remctl.  This is
    apparently standard for Ruby extensions, since it will pull in a
    version of Ruby that can use the extension if the Ruby versions of the
    extension match the providers of ruby-interpreter.
  * Drop Replaces and Breaks on libremctl-ruby1.8 and libremctl-ruby1.9.
    These were already tranditional packages in wheezy.
  * Correctly qualify the libsystemd-daemon-dev dependency with
    [linux-any].  (Closes: #736578)
  * Switch to the new uscan upstream signature verification method, which
    uses an armored key in debian/upstream/signing-key.asc.  This allows
    removal of debian/source/include-binaries.  Export a minimal key to
    save all the space required by key signatures, since inclusion of the
    key in the package already indicates the relevant trust and the
    signatures are retrievable from a public keyserver.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Jan 2014 19:50:20 -0800

remctl (3.7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix client memory leak when remctl_set_ccache is used.
    - Fix Net::Remctl::Backend argument count validation when one of the
      arguments is coming from standard input.
    - remctld in stand-alone mode now supports systemd status notification
      and socket activation and, with -Z, upstart status notification.  By
      default, remctld is still spawned from inetd, so this only affects
      users who change the default configuration.  Sample systemd and
      upstart configurations are included in /usr/share/doc/remctl-server.
    - Net::Remctl classes now fail cleanly if the object is undef.
  * Switch the default Ruby build to 1.9.1 to make it easier to remove the
    Ruby 1.8 module build when ready to do so.
  * Add necessary keyring and watch configuration for uscan to verify
    PGP signatures on new upstream releases.
  * Update the watch file to download *.tar.xz distributions by default.
  * Remove now-unnecessary override of dh_builddeb to use xz compression.
  * Remove old NEWS file that predated the package split for a port
    transition that substantially predated oldstable.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.5 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 06 Jan 2014 15:03:12 -0800

remctl (3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - For client calls with a timeout, restart waiting for a non-blocking
      connect if the select call is interrupted by a signal.
    - Better Net::Remctl::Backend help formatting for commands with long
      syntax.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Aug 2013 21:56:39 -0700

remctl (3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix a long-standing race condition in remctld that could truncate
      large backend output.
    - remctl_set_ccache is now threadsafe when built against a GSS-API
      library that supports gss_krb5_import_cred.
    - The Net::Remctl and Net::Remctl::Backend Perl module versions have
      gone backwards from Perl's perspective to bring them in-line with
      the package version (3.4 -> 3.05).  This is a one-time adjustment
      to a more reliable versioning scheme.
    - Fix test suite issues with newer Linux kernels.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 28 Jun 2013 21:45:30 -0700

remctl (3.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.
  * Drop old Ruby transitional packages required for upgrades from squeeze
    now that wheezy has been released.
  * Add additional Perl modules required to run the full module test suite
    to Build-Depends.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 11 May 2013 16:34:25 -0700

remctl (3.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New C APIs for establishing a remctl connection given a sockaddr, a
      list of struct addrinfo, or an already open socket.
    - New Net::Remctl::Backend Perl module to aid writing remctl backend
      scripts.
    - Remove all prototypes from Net::Remctl functions.
    - Return an error if an empty command is passed to remctl_command.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 26 Mar 2013 13:19:58 -0700

remctl (3.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix a file descriptor leak when checking ACL files.
    - Fix memory leaks in remctld and libremctl.
    - Don't create the PID file in remctld until the network socket is set
      up and listening.
    - Remove prototypes from the Perl remctl() function to allow passing
      in parameters via an array.
  * Use xz compression for the Debian binary packages.
  * Update to standards version 3.9.4.
    - Add branch information to Vcs-Git.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Sep 2012 21:34:43 -0700

remctl (3.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherry-pick upstream fix to flags passed to open() when creating
    sentinel files in the test suite.  Hopefully fixes FTBFS on Hurd.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2012 13:57:28 -0700

remctl (3.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherry-pick upstream fix to add proper dependencies on libremctl.la to
    the build rules for other language bindings.  This should fix
    occasional FTBFS problems with parallel builds.  Thanks, Aaron
    M. Ucko.  (Closes: #679307)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:32:57 -0700

remctl (3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - If remctld receives a help command with no arguments and no help
      command is explicitly defined, it will look for commands to which
      the current user has access and for which the summary option is set
      and run them with the argument given by the summary option,
      collecting the output and sending it back to the client.
    - If remctld receives a help command with one or two arguments and a
      command entry exists matching those arguments, the user has access
      to run it, and the help option is set, the command is run with the
      help option as the subcommand.
    - Always close the server's connection to the client on low-level
      network and GSS-API errors.
    - Fix remctld segfault when the configuration does not define any
      commands.
  * Update Ruby extension packaging for the new Ruby standard.  The
    ruby-remctl package replaces all libremctl-ruby* packages, which are
    now transitional packages to ease the upgrade.  The Ruby extension is
    now installed in the vendor_ruby directory and the modules for all
    supported Ruby versions are included in the same package.
  * Switch to xz compression for the upstream and Debian tarballs.
  * Move single-debian-patch to local-options and patch-header to
    local-patch-header so that they only apply to the packages I build and
    NMUs get regular version-numbered patches.
  * Enable parallel builds.
  * Mark libremctl-dev Multi-Arch: same and remctl-client and
    remctl-server Multi-Arch: foreign.
  * Convert debian/copyright to copyright-format 1.0.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.3 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jun 2012 20:19:03 -0700

remctl (3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New remctl_set_timeout function and corresponding API in all the
      language bindings to set a timeout on all further network operations
      on that client connection.
    - remctld supports a user configuration option to run a program as a
      specific user (with supplemental groups).
    - remctld's timeout is now one hour between messages instead of a
      total limit of one hour for the connection.
    - PHP's remctl_output no longer warns on failure.
    - Python's _remctl.remctl_output returns an empty tuple on error.
    - Fix error reporting for non-blocking connect.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Feb 2012 13:14:14 -0800

remctl (3.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch the upstream build system to provide more hooks for Perl and
    Python builds and make use of them, removing all the complexity in
    debian/rules to selectively rebuild parts of the source.  As a side
    effect, fix application of the hardening flags to all of the
    interpretor modules.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to rebuild the Autotools build system, and link with
    --as-needed to remove the additional unnecessarily library
    dependencies for the client.  Remove the workaround of relinking the
    binary, which removed the hardening flags.
  * Pass the hardening flags into the Perl and Python module rebuilds.
  * Depend on debhelper (>= 9) now that V9 is no longer experimental and
    remove now-unneeded Lintian override.
  * Remove the special additional test run for kfreebsd-amd64.  The
    problem has been located and corrected upstream.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Feb 2012 20:21:09 -0800

remctl (3.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the skip count for the network utility test suite, fixing a
    spurious test failure on systems without IPv6.  Patch from Felix
    Geyer.  (Closes: #654982)
  * Fix removal of build directory paths from RPATH when building the Perl
    module inside a build directory that contains regex metacharacters.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 08 Jan 2012 21:01:28 -0800

remctl (3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable the network timeout test for right now since kfreebsd-amd64 is
    still failing.  Add some additional debugging and run the test with
    full output for now so that this test can hopefully be reinstated in a
    later version.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Nov 2011 19:21:14 -0700

remctl (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Further test suite fixes for kfreebsd: Skip network timeout tests if a
    short listen queue doesn't cause any connections to fail, and fix the
    bounds handling when closing open sockets if all connections
    succeeded.  (Closes: #647254)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Nov 2011 12:47:06 -0700

remctl (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow for different networking behavior seen on kfreebsd systems in
    the test suite.  (Closes: #647254)
    - FreeBSD kernel refuses connections after listen queue exhaustion.
    - getaddrinfo may return other errors on invalid host lookups.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 01 Nov 2011 21:07:03 -0700

remctl (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New protocol version 3, adding a NOOP command.
    - More consistent and formal handling of continuation commands.
    - The server no longer closes the connection after version or error
      replies.
    - Add new remctl_set_source_ip function to set the source IP address
      for outgoing client connections.
    - Add new -b option to remctl command-line client to set source IP.
    - Add new remctl_set_ccache function to specify the credential store
      to use for GSS-API authentication.
    - Fix a client memory leak on remctl_close.
    - Send QUIT to the server when reopening a remctl object.
  * Convert libremctl to multiarch.
  * Update to (experimental) debhelper compatibility level V9.
    - Add Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends} to libremctl1.
    - Use dpkg-buildflags to set CFLAGS.
    - Enable bindnow hardening.  Leave pie off for right now.
    - Add Lintian override for using an experimental debhelper level.
  * Update Python packaging to use dh_python2.
    - Add XS-Python-Version to debian/control.
    - Add python2 debhelper add-on to debian/rules.
    - Remove build dependency on python-support.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Oct 2011 18:05:11 -0700

remctl (2.18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix uninitialized variable in remctld standalone server.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 31 May 2011 17:10:09 -0700

remctl (2.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fix return object construction in the Python simple bindings.
    - Support -b option in remctld to set the bind address.
    - Support IPv6 in remctld when run stand-alone.
    - Add a pkg-config configuration file for libremctl.
    - Set PHP extension test to be noninteractive.
    - Initialize sockaddr structs more correctly.
  * Remove Conflicts/Replaces referring to versions older than oldstable.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.2 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 31 May 2011 15:40:02 -0700

remctl (2.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip the getaddrinfo invalid host test if foo.invalid resolves using
    gethostbyname.  This hopefully works around build issues on kFreeBSD.
    (See #626047)
  * Update network utility library from rra-c-util 3.4 to fix problems
    with the test suite on hosts that bind IPv4 addresses when binding
    IPv6 addresses by default.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 10 May 2011 20:53:25 -0700

remctl (2.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Add Ruby bindings (install libremctl-ruby).
    - Add support for PCRE and regex ACLs in the remctl server.
    - remctld now sets REMCTL_COMMAND to the command run.
  * Use dh_gencontrol -- -V to pass the PHP version substvar instead of
    writing it to the substvars file.
  * Switch to 3.0 (quilt) source format.  Force a single Debian patch and
    include a custom patch header explaining that it is a rollup of any
    fixes cherry-picked from upstream and breaking those patches out
    separately would be work for no gain.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 02 May 2010 18:13:50 -0700

remctl (2.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make use of the new Makefile variables in the upstream 2.15 release to
    control the Python installation and test suite.  Hopefully fixes
    installation with Python 2.6 as the default.  (Closes: #571509)
  * Fix the PHP tests to work properly with PHP 5.3, which no longer
    passes environment variables through to the running test programs.
  * Downgrade the libremctl-dev dependency on libkrb5-dev to suggests
    since it's only required for static linking.
  * Fix a spelling error in the Net::Remctl man page.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.4 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Feb 2010 18:06:48 -0800

remctl (2.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not add php5 as an alternative to the phpapi dependency in
    php5-remctl, fixing problems with the upcoming PHP 5.3 transition.
    Thanks, Raphael Geissert.  (Closes: #566300)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Jan 2010 11:21:37 -0800

remctl (2.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Allow the subcommand to be omitted on the remctl command line.
    - New special keyword EMPTY in remctld configuration.
    - Allow use of ALL for the command in the remctld configuration.
    - Fix read of uninitialized memory when parsing ACL files.
  * Fix debian/rules logic for forcing Python module tests to be run using
    the default version of Python.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Nov 2009 18:51:38 -0800

remctl (2.14-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add --install-layout=deb to the Python setup.py install commands to
    support Python 2.6.
  * Add php5-cli to the build dependencies so that the test suite is run.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V7.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization with overrides.
    - Skip the test suite if nocheck is set in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    - Let dh_install handle installation of remctl.conf.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to all dependencies.
  * Apply a build-time fix to the upstream Makefile to only use the Python
    build directory for the default version of Python.  This is required
    now that make check is run after building Python modules for all
    supported versions.
  * Use the right optimization and warning flags when relinking libremctl.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Aug 2009 19:28:16 -0700

remctl (2.14-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Stop including the protocol documentation in remctl-server.  Add a
    pointer to the remctl-client package for protocol documentation in
    remctl-server's README.Debian.
  * Add a doc-base registration file for the remctl protocol specification
    in remctl-client.
  * Do not install the libremctl.la file.  Libtool *.la files force other
    packages using Libtool to declare excessive library dependencies.
  * Add an explicit build-dependency on Perl.  It was being pulled in by
    other build dependencies, but this is more correct.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.3 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 24 Aug 2009 16:12:57 -0700

remctl (2.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix test suite behavior when IPv6 support is available in the library
    but disabled in the kernel.  Thanks, Peter 'p2' De Schrijver.
    (Closes: #530573)
  * Change php5-remctl's section to php to match override.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 08 Jun 2009 00:21:09 -0700

remctl (2.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - remctld can be configured to pass an argument on standard input.
    - Arguments passed on standard input may now contain nuls.
    - remctld logging now replaces unprintable characters.
    - "command" and "subcommand" are now used instead of "type" and
      "service" in all documentation of remctl commands.
    - Better diagnosis of nul characters in command arguments.
    - Plug several memory leaks in the remctld server.
  * Allow php5 as an alternative for the phpapi dependency to avoid a
    Lintian warning (although I'm not sure this change is correct and need
    to investigate further later).
  * Update standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes required).

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 22 May 2009 16:20:45 -0700

remctl (2.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upload to unstable.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Feb 2009 20:13:34 -0800

remctl (2.13-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Call open() with the correct arguments when creating a sentinel file

remctl (2.13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - New PHP PECL bindings for libremctl (php5-remctl).
    - New Python remctl extension (python-remctl).
    - Add support for ACL methods to the remctld server.
    - Add the deny ACL method to reject authentication by certain users.
    - Add the princ ACL method, allowing direct specification of
      particular principals in the main configuration file.
    - When processing the include of a directory for configuration or ACL
      files, limit the files included to characters in [a-zA-Z0-9_-] to
      avoid editor temporary files.  (Closes: #479481)
  * On new installations of remctl-server, add the inetd.conf line with
    the symbolic protocol name rather than the port number.  Depend on a
    new enough version of netbase.  Remove that line in prerm.
  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser control fields.
  * Update standards version to 3.8.0 (no changes required).
