This directory contains configuration required to run the complete remctl
test suite.  If there is no configuration in this directory, some of the
tests will be skipped.  To enable the full test suite, create the
following files:

keytab

    A valid Kerberos keytab for a principal, preferrably in your local
    realm.  This will be used to test network interactions that require
    Kerberos authentication.

principal

    The name of the Kerberos principal whose keys are stored in keytab on
    a single line ending with a newline.

If you are building in a different directory tree than the source tree,
don't put the files in this directory.  Instead, after running configure,
you will have an empty tests/config directory in your build tree.  Put the
keytab and principal files in that directory instead.
